# MARC2RDA
Mapping between MARC21 and RDA-RDF
## About
This is a project of the Metadata and Cataloging Initiatives Unit of the Cataloging and Metadata Services Department at the University of Washington Libraries initiated in 2021 to create a more robust mapping between the MARC21 bibliographic format and RDA-RDF, with the goal of facilitating a future project to create a corresponding data conversion tool. Authority data is out of scope for this mapping. This project builds on the work of the RDA/MARC 21 Alignment Task Force within the RSC Technical Working Group, specifically the mapping available [here.](http://www.rdaregistry.info/Maps/mapRDA2M21B.html)
