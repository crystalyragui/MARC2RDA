# MARC2RDA
Mapping and transformation between MARC21 and RDA-RDF
## About
This is a project of the Metadata and Cataloging Initiatives Unit of the Cataloging and Metadata Services Department at the University of Washington Libraries initiated in 2021 to create an open source, robust mapping between the MARC21 bibliographic format and RDA-RDF and a corresponding conversion tool. Authority data is out of scope for this mapping. This project builds on the work of the RDA/MARC 21 Alignment Task Force within the RSC Technical Working Group, specifically the mapping available [here.](http://www.rdaregistry.info/Maps/mapRDA2M21B.html)
