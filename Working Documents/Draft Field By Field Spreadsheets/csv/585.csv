The minted item URI relates as a holding to a manifestation (minted IRI)of a collection, with appellation ""Collection of [named organization assigned the code in MARC Code List for Organizations]"". This manifestation ""manifests"" (shortcut) a work (minted IRI, collection, WEMI lock) which has a collector corporate body (minted IRI), This corporate body has an identifier for agent that is a Nomen, (minted IRI) with an identifier for agent that is a text string, content of $5, and scheme of nomen provided as a string of the URL for the MARC Code List for Organizations.","This mapping generates a different item URI for each field containing a $5 in order to  establish a relatinship with manifestation and apply notes or other relations according to the field content. The result may easily have redundant item IRIs when only a single item exists, since practice at many institutions results in $5 in multiple fields in description of rare materials or archives.  Data in MARC is not sufficient to identify specific items or relate item data from different parts of the reccord with specific generated IRI identifiers. Item data may thus require manual reconciliation after conversion, depending on the institution's needs.","See Subfield 5 discussion https://github.com/uwlib-cams/MARC2RDA/discussions/361  No characteristics can be supplied for the item or association with specifric identifiers based on this subfield.
