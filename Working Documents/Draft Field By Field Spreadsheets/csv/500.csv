The result may easily have redundant item IRIs when only a single item exists, since practice at many institutions results in $5 in multiple fields in description of rare materials or archives.  Data in MARC is not sufficient to identify specific items or relate item data from different parts of the reccord with specific generated IRI identifiers.
