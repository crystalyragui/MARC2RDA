The transform avoids loss of information from the MARC record by representing it in SKOS, which is also used by the RDA Registry to map concepts, etc. SKOS is also used, sometimes partially, in existing representations of subject and classification schemes, so all of this is a 'best' fit with community norms. This transform is essentially creating RDF representations of those concept vocabularies from legacy records, independently from the M212RDA transform, and then connecting them to the RDA graph. Personally, I wonder why this has not been done before (it has nothing to do with RDA, and SKOS is a W3C recommended standard); perhaps we will find out when we run the transform! RDA is designed to be used in this way.-- Gordon 03/01/2024","<work> rdawo:P10256 <ConceptLCC(“value of $a”)> . // duplicates https://id.loc.gov/authorities/classification/“value of $a”

<ConceptLCC(“value of $a”)> skos:inScheme https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/classSchemes/lcc .","See Example 1 below. The transform mints the concept URI ConceptLCC(“Z699.35.M28”) (e.g. http://transform/lcc/hash(Z699.35.M28)), but LCC already has a URI for the same concept: https://id.loc.gov/authorities/classification/Z699.35.M28 .
After the transform is run, the transform URI can be de-duplicated agains the LoC URI if required. The outcome is a merging of the transform concept graph with the official scheme graph.
We have decided not to directly use the LCC URI for 2 reasons:
1. Not all LCC numbers have an LCC RDF URI.
2. The LCC graph contains statements using fuzzy semantics from MADS and other LoC ontologies that appear to be inconsistent. The transform allows its used to merge with LoC or not.
