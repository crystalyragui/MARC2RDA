PS 7/9/2024",It is part of the expression which cannot be mapped directly to the expression being described.,I don't think it is possible to determine which expression this data is associated with. In most cases the subfield definition indicates separate expressions embodied in an aggregate but in some cases the language is associated with a component of the expression (for example the words to a song printed above the notated music - RDA has not yet fully modelled this). I think the safest approach is transform the data as note on manifestation. The note would have to mention 'language encodings' unless we want to look-up the full form on the fly (not recommended).--Gordon 7/15/2024
